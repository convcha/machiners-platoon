# ü§ñ Machiners Platoon

An automated development agent squadron powered by GitHub Actions that transforms issues into production-ready pull requests.

## Overview

Machiners Platoon is a collection of 5 specialized AI bots that work together to automatically implement features, from initial issue analysis to final code review. Simply create an issue, add a label, and watch as the system enhances requirements, creates implementation plans, writes code, and prepares pull requests for review.

## Features

- **Automated Development Workflow**: Complete automation from issue to PR
- **Intelligent Routing**: Automatically determines if features need architectural planning
- **Multi-Agent Collaboration**: 5 specialized bots handle different aspects of development
- **Cost Control**: Built-in cycle limits prevent runaway AI costs
- **Language Agnostic**: Easily adaptable to any programming language or framework
- **Security First**: Human oversight required for final approval and merge

## Quick Start

### Automated Integration

Use with [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/overview) or other coding agents:

```bash
claude "https://github.com/convcha/machiners-platoon Integrate this GitHub Actions into my project"
```

For busy developers (skip permission prompts - use at your own risk):
```bash
claude --dangerously-skip-permissions "https://github.com/convcha/machiners-platoon Integrate this GitHub Actions into my project"
```

### Manual Integration

1. **Copy workflow files** to your repository's `.github/workflows/`:
   - `product-manager-bot.yml`
   - `system-architect-bot.yml`
   - `engineer-bot.yml`
   - `architect-review-bot.yml`
   - `engineer-fixes-bot.yml`

2. **Copy the custom action** to `.github/actions/claude-result-tracker/`:
   - `action.yml`

3. **Configure GitHub repository settings**:
   - Enable "Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests"
   - Path: Settings ‚Üí Actions ‚Üí General ‚Üí Workflow permissions

4. **Add required secrets**:
   - `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` - Your Claude API key
   - `GH_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN` - GitHub token with repo permissions

## Usage

1. **Create an issue** with your feature request or bug report
2. **Add the `ü§ñ Machiners Platoon` label** to trigger automation
3. **Watch the magic happen**:
   - Issue gets enhanced with detailed requirements
   - Implementation plan is created (if needed)
   - Code is implemented and PR is created
   - Automated review and feedback cycles run
   - PR is prepared for human review and merge

## Bot Squadron

### Product Manager Bot
Analyzes and enhances issues, provides complexity estimates, and intelligently routes to appropriate downstream bots.

### System Architect Bot
Creates detailed technical implementation plans for complex features, analyzing existing codebase patterns.

### Engineer Bot
Implements features according to plans, creates feature branches, runs validation, and creates pull requests.

### Architect Review Bot
Reviews implementations for quality, security, and architectural compliance with automatic feedback cycles.

### Engineer Fixes Bot
Addresses review feedback systematically and maintains code quality throughout iterations.

## Project Adaptation

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: The included workflows are configured for Node.js projects. You must adapt them for your technology stack:

### Required Changes

Update the following in `engineer-bot.yml` and `engineer-fixes-bot.yml`:

```yaml
# Replace Node.js setup with your language
- name: Setup [Your Language]
  uses: [appropriate-setup-action]

# Replace package manager
- name: Install Dependencies
  run: [your-install-command]
```

### Examples by Language

- **Python**: `setup-python` + `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- **Go**: `setup-go` + `go mod download`
- **Java**: `setup-java` + `mvn install` or `gradle build`
- **Rust**: `dtolnay/rust-toolchain` + `cargo build`

## Configuration

### Repository Settings

Enable PR creation in **Settings ‚Üí Actions ‚Üí General**:
- ‚úÖ Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests

### Required Secrets

Add in **Settings ‚Üí Secrets and variables ‚Üí Actions**:
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` - Claude API key for AI operations
- `GH_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN` - GitHub token for repository operations

### Required Permissions

The GitHub token needs:
- Pull Requests: Read and write
- Issues: Read and write  
- Contents: Read and write
- Actions: Write (for dispatch events)
- Metadata: Read

## Cost Management

- **Cycle Limits**: Maximum 3 review iterations to control costs
- **Smart Routing**: Intelligent decisions to avoid unnecessary operations
- **Execution Tracking**: Detailed cost and duration tracking for all operations
- **Automatic Stopping**: Prevents infinite loops and runaway costs

## Security

- Bots cannot approve or merge PRs - human oversight required
- Limited repository scope with specific tool allowances
- Automatic commit signing
- Secure API key storage in GitHub secrets
- Built-in cycle protection prevents abuse

## Labels

- `ü§ñ Machiners Platoon` - Main trigger label (never removed automatically)
- `ü§ñ Review Cycle 1/2/3` - Tracks review iterations
- `ü§ñ Architect Approved` - PR ready for human review
- `üö® Manual Review Required` - Human intervention needed
- `ü§ñ Max Cycles Reached` - Automation stopped due to limits
