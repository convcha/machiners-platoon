# 🤖 Machiners Platoon - GitHub Development Agent Squadron

This project contains the GitHub Actions workflows that implement the **Machiners Platoon**, an automated development agent squadron for your project.

## Getting Started for Humans

Try talking to your coding agent to integrate this workflow.

### Example: [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/overview)
```shell
claude "https://github.com/convcha/machiners-platoon Read the 'Getting Started for Coding Agents' section and integrate this GitHub Actions into the project"
```

For busy developers (skip permission prompts - use at your own risk):
```shell
claude --dangerously-skip-permissions "https://github.com/convcha/machiners-platoon Read the 'Getting Started for Coding Agents' section and integrate this GitHub Actions into the project"
```

## Getting Started for Coding Agents

When integrating Machiners Platoon into a project, follow these steps:

### 1. Integrate GitHub Actions

Copy the workflow files from this repository to the target project's `.github/workflows/` directory:
- `product-manager-bot.yml`
- `system-architect-bot.yml` 
- `engineer-bot.yml`
- `architect-review-bot.yml`
- `engineer-fixes-bot.yml`

Copy the custom action for cost tracking to `.github/actions/claude-result-tracker/`:
- `action.yml`

**Project Adaptation:** See the "⚠️ Important: Project Adaptation Required" section below for details on adapting workflows to the target project's technology stack.

### 2. Setup and Usage Instructions

After integration, display the following setup and usage information to the user in the CLI terminal:

**Required Configuration:**
- Navigate to **Settings → Actions → General** in the target repository
- Enable "Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests"
- Add required GitHub secrets:
  - `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` - Claude API key for all bots
  - `GH_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN` - Personal access token for repository dispatch events

**How to Use Machiners Platoon:**
1. **Create an issue** with any feature request or bug report
2. **Add the `🤖 Machiners Platoon` label** to trigger automation
3. **The system will automatically:**
   - Enhance the issue with detailed requirements
   - Create implementation plans if needed
   - Implement the feature and create a pull request
   - Review the implementation with feedback loops
   - Prepare the PR for human review and merge

The entire process is automated from issue creation to production-ready code, with built-in cost controls and cycle protection.

## 🔧 Setup Requirements

### Required GitHub Repository Settings

**Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests**

Machiners Platoon requires GitHub Actions to have permission to create pull requests. This setting must be enabled in your repository:

1. Go to your repository **Settings** → **Actions** → **General**
2. Scroll down to **Workflow permissions**
3. Check the box **"Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests"**

### Required GitHub Secrets

- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` - Claude API key for all bots
- `GH_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN` - Personal access token for repository dispatch events

### Required Permissions

The Claude GitHub app needs:

- **Pull Requests**: Read and write
- **Issues**: Read and write
- **Contents**: Read and write
- **Actions**: Write (for repository dispatch events)
- **Metadata**: Read

## ⚠️ Important: Project Adaptation Required

**When using these workflows in your project, you MUST modify the project setup steps:**

The Engineer Bot (`engineer-bot.yml`) and Engineer Fixes Bot (`engineer-fixes-bot.yml`) workflows contain Node.js-specific setup steps that need to be adapted for your project:

```yaml
# NOTE FOR CODING AGENTS: Please modify the following steps (Setup Node.js to Install dependencies)
# according to your project's requirements.
# Examples:
# - For Python projects: use setup-python action
# - For Go projects: use setup-go action  
# - For Java projects: use setup-java action
# - For other languages: use appropriate setup actions
```

**Required Modifications:**
- Replace `Setup Node.js` step with appropriate language setup action
- Replace `Install pnpm` step with your package manager
- Replace `pnpm install` with your dependency installation command
- Update validation commands in bot instructions (`pnpm`, `npm`, `pip`, `go mod`, etc.)

**Examples for Different Languages:**
- **Python**: Use `setup-python` action, `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- **Go**: Use `setup-go` action, `go mod download`
- **Java**: Use `setup-java` action, `mvn install` or `gradle build`
- **Rust**: Use `dtolnay/rust-toolchain` action, `cargo build`

- Validates security and performance considerations
- Provides detailed feedback with specific line references
- Ensures integration with existing systems
- **Review Cycle Protection**: Maximum 3 review cycles to prevent infinite loops
- Automatically triggers Engineer Fixes Bot or Preview Deployment based on review outcome

### 5. Engineer Bot - PR Fixes (`engineer-fixes-bot.yml`)

**Trigger**: Repository dispatch event `🔧 Fixes Required` or `🤖engineer` mentions in PR comments

- Addresses review feedback systematically
- Implements requested fixes and improvements
- Maintains code quality throughout fixes
- Runs comprehensive validation (e.g. Full lint, format, and typecheck) after fixes
- **Review Cycle Protection**: Respects maximum cycle limits
- Automatically triggers re-review by Architect Bot

## 🎯 Usage

### For New Features

1. Create an issue with any content
2. Add the `🤖 Machiners Platoon` label to trigger the automation
3. The Product Manager Bot will automatically enhance the issue and trigger appropriate next steps
4. The full automation chain will run without further intervention

## 🔄 Automated Workflow Chain

The Machiners Platoon operates via sophisticated repository dispatch events:

1. **Issue Creation** → Human creates issue and adds `🤖 Machiners Platoon` label
2. **Product Manager Bot** → Enhances issue, analyzes complexity, makes intelligent routing decisions
    - Creates `architect_decision.json` with next action: `architect`, `direct_implementation`, or `none`
3. **Automatic Routing**:
    - **Complex features** → Dispatches `🏛️ Architecture Review` event
    - **Simple features** → Dispatches `🛠️ Lets Build This` event directly
4. **System Architect Bot** (if needed) → Creates technical plan, dispatches `🛠️ Lets Build This`
5. **Engineer Bot** → Implements feature, creates PR, dispatches `🏗️ Architect PR Review`
6. **Architect Review Bot** → Reviews PR, creates review cycle tracking
    - **If issues found** → Dispatches `🔧 Fixes Required`
    - **If approved** → Dispatches `🚀 Deploy Preview` and adds `🤖: Architect Approved` label
7. **Engineer Fixes Bot** (if needed) → Addresses feedback, dispatches `🏗️ Architect PR Review` for re-review
8. **Cycle Protection** → Maximum 3 review cycles to prevent infinite loops and control costs

### Repository Dispatch Events

- `🏛️ Architecture Review` → Triggers System Architect Bot
- `🛠️ Lets Build This` → Triggers Engineer Bot implementation
- `🏗️ Architect PR Review` → Triggers Architect Review Bot
- `🔧 Fixes Required` → Triggers Engineer Fixes Bot
- `🚀 Deploy Preview` → Triggers preview deployment

### Manual Override Triggers

- `🤖engineer` in PR comments → Manually trigger Engineer Fixes Bot
- Review cycle labels can be manually removed to reset automation

### Automated Labels

- `🤖 Machiners Platoon` → Required label to trigger automation (never removed)
- `🤖: Review Cycle 1/2/3` → Tracks review iterations
- `🤖: Architect Approved` → PR approved and ready for merge
- `🚨: Manual Review Required` → Maximum cycles reached, human intervention needed
- `🤖: Max Cycles Reached` → Automation stopped due to cycle limits


## 🛡️ Security Features

- All bots operate with limited repository scope
- Commits are automatically signed
- API keys are securely stored in GitHub secrets
- Bots cannot approve PRs (security measure)
- Human oversight required for final merge
- **Review Cycle Limits**: Maximum 3 automated review cycles to prevent infinite loops
- **Cost Control**: Automatic stopping of expensive AI operations when limits are reached
- **Manual Override**: Cycle limits can be reset manually when appropriate

## 🔄 Cost Management

- **Execution Tracking**: Each bot execution is tracked with cost information
- **Cycle Limits**: Maximum 3 review iterations to control AI costs
- **Smart Routing**: Product Manager Bot makes intelligent decisions to avoid unnecessary architect reviews
- **Automatic Stopping**: Bots stop automatically when cycle limits are reached
