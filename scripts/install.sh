# Machiners Platoon Installation Script
#==============================================================================
#
# PURPOSE:
#   This script installs the complete Machiners Platoon automated development
#   agent squadron into a GitHub repository. It sets up 5 specialized AI bots
#   that work together through repository dispatch events to implement a 
#   complete development workflow from issue creation to pull request deployment.
#
# DESCRIPTION:
#   The Machiners Platoon consists of:
#   - Product Manager Bot: Enhances issues and routes to appropriate bots
#   - System Architect Bot: Creates technical implementation plans
#   - Engineer Bot: Implements features and creates PRs
#   - Architect Review Bot: Reviews PRs with cycle protection
#   - Engineer Fixes Bot: Addresses review feedback
#
# PREREQUISITES:
#   - bash shell (version 4.0 or higher recommended)
#   - curl command available in PATH
#   - Internet connectivity to download files from GitHub
#   - Write permissions to create .github/ directory structure
#   - Running from the root directory of your Git repository
#
# USAGE:
#   ./scripts/install.sh
#
#   OR
#
#   bash scripts/install.sh
#
# PERMISSIONS:
#   This script requires write permissions to create directories and files
#   under the .github/ folder in your repository root.
#
# EXIT CODES:
#   0 - Installation completed successfully
#   1 - Installation failed (due to set -e error handling)

#==============================================================================

# ERROR HANDLING STRATEGY:
# Enable strict error handling - script will exit immediately if any command
# returns a non-zero exit status. This ensures that installation failures
# are caught early and don't result in a partially installed system.

# DIRECTORY STRUCTURE SETUP
#==============================================================================
# Create the required directory structure for GitHub Actions workflows and
# custom actions. The -p flag ensures parent directories are created if they
# don't exist and prevents errors if directories already exist.

echo "> Creating directories..."

# Create the workflows directory to store GitHub Actions workflow files
# This directory will contain all the bot workflow YAML files
mkdir -p .github/workflows

# Create the custom actions directory for the claude-result-tracker action
# This action tracks bot execution costs, duration, and token usage
mkdir -p .github/actions/claude-result-tracker

#==============================================================================
# WORKFLOW FILES DOWNLOAD
#==============================================================================
# Download all GitHub Actions workflow files that define the bot behaviors.
# Each workflow implements a specialized bot in the development pipeline.
# The -s flag suppresses curl's progress output for cleaner installation logs.
